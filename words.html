               <p class='title'> Dear Dina,</p> I write this to you as your lover, from my heart to yours. On the main page of this website,
                I was talking about you in the third person, but here, I speak to you. Nothing I have ever said has ever been as 
                truthful or heartfelt as what you read right now. Dina my love, you mean the world to me. I live my life for you, and nothing makes me happier
                than seeing you happy. You truly are a blessing. Some refer to the good people they meet as blessings in disguise, but to me, your a blessing that shines too bright for me to not recognize it.
                I love you Dina, your my soulmate and lover forever. It might seem like we've been through it all together, rough and sweet, but this is not even the beginning yet. Inshallah Allah will bless us with a life so long together it will make the time we spent together so far seem like nothing but a few months. A few months huh. Can you imagine thats all weve known each other for, and youre already closer to my heart than anyone else. I hope this lived up to the hype I gave it, and I may have not one upped you per se, but I hope it shows just how much I adore you. Dina. I love you so much bby <3

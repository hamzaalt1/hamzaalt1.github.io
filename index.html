                   Dina Rasheed is a wonderful twent- I mean eighteen year old girl from Palestine, who lives in Merritt Island, Florida, One faitful day
                   I was playing the video game League of legends and I happened to have queued with her and some of her friends as teammates. After
                thoroughly DESTROYING the enemy team, they decided to invite us to a discord server, and so both Dina and her friends, as well as myself joined this server.

                <div class="desc">
                    Over the next few weeks, I grew very close to Dina, asking her for first her Snapchat then her instagram, and texting her nonstop. She became an irreplaceable part of my day. Spending time with her brought me happiness that I couldn't explain, but I was too shy to tell her anything. Can you blame me though, she's literally stunning.

                        Over the next summer we both traveled, her to Palestine and myself to Jordan. Although we didn't talk as much over the vacation, 
                        how I felt for her did not change, and when we got back, I was ecstatic to know that she was happy to be 
                        able to talk to me more too. We talked and talked until just talking without expressing how we felt wasn't enough. She made the first move, and i was simply in bisbelief.
                        A girl as funny as her, as beautiful as her and as joyful as her, likes me?!?! Nah, no way. But this wasn't a dream, it was real

                    Texting turned into snapping pictures, and snapping turned into calling. The more time I spent with her the more I
                    realized just how much she was the one. The one whos finger I wanna wrap with a diamond ring. Everything she did put a smile on my face, adn everything she did, she did intending to put a smile on my face. She truly loves me, just as I love her.

                <div class="desc">
                    Telling her I love her was the biggest leap of faith I have ever taken, and it has payed off more than anything I have ever done. I can't imagine my life wihtout her, nor do I want to.
                    She's mine and I won't let anyone else have her

                <div class="desc">
                    Her smile, her laugh, the way she tilts her head when she's flustered. Everything about her makes life worth living. No thats not it, everything about her makes me NEED to live. I want to live my life with her and for her, adn watch her do the same for me.
